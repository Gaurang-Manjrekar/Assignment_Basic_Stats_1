## Q3: Probability of Two Heads and One Tail When Tossing Three Coins

P(two heads and one tail) = 3/8 = 0.375 (37.5%)

## Q4: Two Dice Are Rolled

- Sample space: n(S) = 36

**a)** Sum = 1  
Event is impossible ⇒ P=0

**b)** Sum ≤ 4  
Events: (1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (1,3), (2,2), (3,1)  
P(B) = 6/36 = 1/6 ≈ 0.16

**c)** Sum divisible by 2 and 3  
Events: (1,5), (2,4), (3,3), (4,2), (5,1), (6,6)  
P(C) = 6/36 = 1/6 ≈ 0.16

## Q5: Probability That None of Two Randomly Drawn Balls Is Blue

Bag contains 2 red, 3 green and 2 blue (total 7).

Ways to draw 2 balls: C(7,2) = 21  
Ways to draw 2 non-blue balls: C(5,2) = 10  
P = 10/21 ≈ 0.476

## Q6: Expected Number of Candies per Child

| Child | Candies | Probability |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| A     | 1       | 0.015       |
| B     | 4       | 0.20        |
| C     | 3       | 0.65        |
| D     | 5       | 0.005       |
| E     | 6       | 0.01        |
| F     | 2       | 0.12        |

Expected candies = Σ(candies × probability) = **3.09**

## Q8: Expected Weight of a Random Patient

Weights (lb): 108, 110, 123, 134, 135, 145, 167, 187, 199  
Expected value = average = **145.33 lb**

## Q10: Inferences from Boxplot & Histogram

1. Histogram is right-skewed ⇒ data not normally distributed; possible outliers.
2. Boxplot indicates presence of outliers.

## Q12: Student Test Scores

Scores: 34, 36, 36, 38, 38, 39, 39, 40, 40, 41, 41, 41, 41, 42, 42, 45, 49, 56

Mean = 41  
Median = 40.5  
Variance = 25.52  
Standard deviation = 5.05

The data has no outliers and is slightly right-skewed (mean > median).

## Q13: Nature of Skewness When Mean = Median

Distribution is perfectly symmetrical.

## Q14: Nature of Skewness When Mean > Median

Right-skewed.

## Q15: Nature of Skewness When Median > Mean

Left-skewed.

## Q16: Positive Kurtosis

Distribution is more peaked (leptokurtic).

## Q17: Negative Kurtosis

Distribution is flatter and broader (platykurtic).

## Q18: Boxplot Interpretation

- Distribution is not normal; median is towards the higher end.
- Data is left-skewed (lower whisker longer).
- Approximate IQR = 18 − 10 = 8.

## Q19: Comparing Two Boxplots

- No outliers in either plot.
- Both share roughly the same median (~250–275).
- Distributions appear symmetric.

## Q21: Checking Normality

- **Cars.csv (MPG):** follows normal distribution.
- **wc-at.csv (Adipose Tissue and Waist):** does **not** follow normal distribution.
